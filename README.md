# Lorenz Attractor Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains a one-page website that visualizes the Lorenz Attractorâ€”a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz equations. The Lorenz Attractor serves as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection and is a classic example illustrating the concept of chaos theory. The visualization includes a 3D path (the attractor) and an animated ball representing a point evolving over time according to the Lorenz equations.
